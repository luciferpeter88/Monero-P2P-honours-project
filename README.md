# Monero-P2P-honours-project

# Project Introduction

This project focuses on creating a peer-to-peer trading platform for Monero (XMR), providing users with a secure and transparent environment for trading. Inspired by platforms like LocalBitcoins, this platform enables users to create buy or sell offers for Monero. Transactions are facilitated through direct bank transfers, ensuring that fiat money is sent directly to the seller. Once the seller confirms receipt of the payment, Monero is transferred to the buyerâ€™s wallet on the platform.

## Key Features

- **User Wallets**: Each user has an integrated wallet within the platform to store, send, and receive Monero securely.
- **Buy/Sell Offers**: Users can create and browse offers to trade Monero with potential partners.
- **Messaging System**: A chat feature for seamless communication between users during trades.

## Technology Stack

1. **Python**: Handles Monero-related tasks, such as transaction processing and integration with the Monero network.
2. **PostgreSQL**: Manages structured data, including user profiles, transaction histories, and offer listings.
3. **MongoDB**: Stores dynamic and unstructured data like chat logs for faster retrieval and scalability.
4. **Remix.js**: Acts as the backend framework, leveraging React for server-side rendering, routing, and data loading. It also handles dynamic routing and interactions with the backend APIs to provide a seamless experience.

## Security and Transparency

The platform prioritizes security through **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** to safeguard user accounts. All transactions, both fiat and Monero, are carefully tracked to ensure clarity and transparency during the trading process.
